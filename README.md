# ISL_prediction
This repository consists of files that can predict Indian Sign Language from a video using SVM machine learning algorithm


Libraries needed to run this project

skimage                           # for image processing #
numpy                             # for maths #
cv2                               # image processing and feature extraction algorithms #
time                              # to track time #
scikit learn                      # SVM algorithm #
joblib                            # to store trained models as files #
os                                # read and write files from Hard disk #

You also need various test image set and train image set, I have created a simple test dataset with few images here is the google drive link
